As a developer, you know that typesafety is important in order to avoid bugs and unwanted edge cases. But what exactly is typesafety, and why does it matter? In this blog post, we'll explore the concept of typesafety and why it's so important for long-term development projects. By the end, you'll understand why types matter and how they can benefit your workflow. Let's get started!

## What is typesafety and why is it important in development?
Typesafety is a key element of proper development. It’s not just another line in the code; it’s actually the foundation for effective and organized projects, especially in startups and when creating new products. Typesafety helps prevent unwanted bugs and edge cases from arising, both in the short-term and long-term. By taking a proactive approach to typesafety, you can save yourself time, money, and effort - so it's an essential part of the development process. Put simply - typesafety matters.

## How can typesafety help avoid unwanted bugs and edge cases in your code?
Typesafety is key to clean code and avoiding unwanted bugs and edge cases before they reach production. By explicitly defining types for your variables and functions, you ensure that the code not only runs cleanly but that errors flag up much earlier in the development process, allowing you to debug with confidence. In a startup or product-building environment where both long-term and short-term goals need to be achieved, typesafety can give you the cleanest solution in terms of clean code and assured results. Using typesafety can help save time and money by catching errors before they ever make it into production and break user experience or public perception of a product.

## How can following best practices for typesafe development help ensure a successful product launch?
When launching a product, following best practices for typesafe development is vital for ensuring successful results. Not only does this reduce debugging time and scale faster with onboarding, but it also reduces costs because you are on the right track to a shorter development cycle. Avoiding avoidable bugs and edge cases that come with using scripts instead of typesafe code allows you to scale faster than you would with the latter and launch the second version of your product even faster. Typesafe development helps you ensure that the codebase is robust, efficient, and scaleable – three elements necessary for a successful product launch.

## Conclusion
Understanding what typesafety is and how it can impact your development process is critical for building a successful product. By avoiding unwanted bugs and edge cases, you can ensure that your product meets customer expectations and performs as intended. Additionally, considering both the long-term and short-term effects of type usage will help you make informed decisions about the best way to develop your product. Following best practices for typesafe development will help ensure a successful product launch.
